# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: Cannot read properties of undefined

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 15 applications and provides a solution.

## Problem

The application throws a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProperty')` error. This typically occurs when attempting to access a property of an object that is unexpectedly undefined.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking for undefined values before accessing their properties.  This often involves using optional chaining (?.) or the nullish coalescing operator (??).

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

You'll observe the error in the browser's console.
